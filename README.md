## Open Data pipeline to model COVID-19 for WorldSituationRoom.com 


At a time of unprecedented uncertainty and volatility, our mission is to provide a single source of accurate and timely information about health and economic data.

Through this data pipeline, we will be covering the daily updates on the spread of the C19 pandemic.

We welcome suggestions for improvement , we are happy to consider partnerships with other providers of key intelligence, and we trust that  those who utilize and benefit from the site will consider donating funds for the maintenance and enhancement of the site on a one off or regular basis. 
 

## About this data

It changes rapidly.

This data changes rapidly, so what’s shown may be out of date.

It doesn’t include all cases
Confirmed cases aren’t all cases. They only include people who tested positive. Testing rules and availability vary by country.
